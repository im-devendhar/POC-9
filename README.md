##  Required Tools

### 1. Git
Used for version control and pulling code from GitHub.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```

### 2. Java (OpenJDK 17)
Required for running Jenkins.
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre -y
```

### 3. Jenkins
Automates build and deployment processes.
```bash
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

### 4. Docker
Used to build and run containerized applications.
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
```

### 5. Ansible
Used for configuration management and deployment automation.
```bash
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

#  Fixing SSH Connection Issues in Ansible (EC2 + Jenkins)

When running **Ansible playbooks** from Jenkins to deploy on an **AWS EC2 instance**, you may see this error:

```
UNREACHABLE! => Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Host key verification failed.
```

This usually happens because Ansible cannot authenticate with the EC2 instance over SSH.
The fix is to ensure the **private key (`Dev.pem`)** is available on the EC2 instance where Jenkins/Ansible is running.

##  Step 1: Copy `Dev.pem` into EC2 Instance

Run this command from your **local machine** (where you downloaded the `.pem` file from AWS):

```bash
scp -i "C:/Users/DEVENDHAR B/Downloads/Dev.pem" \
"C:/Users/DEVENDHAR B/Downloads/Dev.pem" \
ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:/home/ubuntu/
```

 What this does:

* `-i "Dev.pem"` → Uses the key to authenticate with the EC2 instance.
* Copies the file `Dev.pem` → Into `/home/ubuntu/` on the EC2 instance.

---

## Step 2: Set Correct Permissions

Log into your EC2 instance and set restrictive permissions:

```bash
chmod 400 /home/ubuntu/Dev.pem
```

This prevents SSH from rejecting the key because of insecure permissions.

---

##  Step 3: Configure Ansible Inventory

Tell Ansible which host to connect to and which key to use.
Update your **inventory** file (e.g., `inventory`):

```ini
[web]
3.95.6.197 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/Dev.pem
```

---

##  Step 4: Run the Playbook

Now you can run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml
```

Ansible should connect successfully to your EC2 instance using the copied `Dev.pem`.

---

##  Why This Works

* EC2 instances **require SSH key-based authentication** (no password login).
* Jenkins/Ansible running on the EC2 host needs access to the **private key**.
* By copying `Dev.pem` and configuring it in the Ansible inventory, you allow secure, verified SSH access.


##  Jenkins Plugin Setup

To integrate Jenkins with GitHub, Docker, and Ansible, install the following plugins:

###  Essential Plugins
- **GitHub Plugin** – Enables GitHub integration.
- **Git Plugin** – Required for Git operations.
- **GitHub Branch Source Plugin** – For multibranch pipelines.
- **Pipeline Plugin** – Enables Jenkinsfile-based pipelines.
- **Docker Pipeline Plugin** – For Docker operations in pipelines.
- **Ansible Plugin** – Allows Jenkins to run Ansible playbooks.
- **GitHub API Plugin** – Supports GitHub-related features.

###  How to Install
1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard → `Manage Jenkins` → `Manage Plugins`.
2. Under the **Available** tab, search and install the plugins listed above.
3. Restart Jenkins if required.



##  GitHub Webhook Configuration

To trigger Jenkins builds automatically when code is pushed to GitHub:

###  Steps:
1. Go to your GitHub repository → `Settings` → `Webhooks` → `Add webhook`.
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Payload URL**:  
     ```
     http://<your-jenkins-server-ip>:8080/github-webhook/
     ```
   - **Content type**:  
     ```
     application/json
     ```
   - **Events**:  
     Select “Just the push event”.
   - **Active**:  
      Checked
3. Click **Add webhook**.

###  Jenkins Job Configuration
- Go to your Jenkins job → `Configure`.
- Under **Build Triggers**, check:
  ```
  GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
  ```

##  Deployment Steps Using Ansible

Once Jenkins builds the Docker image, Ansible can be used to deploy it:

### Workflow
1. Jenkins triggers an Ansible playbook post-build.
2. The playbook connects to target servers via SSH.
3. It pulls the Docker image and runs the container.

###  Example Jenkins Pipeline Snippet
```groovy
post {
  success {
    sh 'ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml'
  }
}
```

###  Required Files
- `inventory`: Defines target hosts.
- `deploy.yml`: Ansible playbook for deployment.

##  Additional Setup

- Configure GitHub webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs.
- Install Jenkins plugins for GitHub, Docker, and Ansible integration.
- Set up SSH keys if Ansible needs to connect to remote servers.
